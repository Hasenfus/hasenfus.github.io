    <h2>Ideals of a Personal Assistant: From Mitigation to Enhancement</h2>
    
    <p>Having established the philosophical foundations of autonomy and the developmental challenges of AI systems, I want to explore what it means to build AI assistants that genuinely respect and enhance human agency rather than undermining it.</p>
    
    <h3>The Core Question</h3>
    
    <p>How can we have personal assistants and coaches in the future that are locally governed, maintain privacy, personally governable, and not be addictive? This question builds directly on our understanding of autonomy as self-determination and the recognition that AI systems are becoming developmental agents.</p>
    
    <h3>Reconsidering the Premise</h3>
    
    <p>It's almost as if I was approaching this problem with the premise of technology increasing or maintaining its grip, as if the grip was something needed. In other words, I see the attention allocated as a form of manipulation and coercion at present. The attention in the future is going to increase tenfoldâ€”I spend hours talking to AI agents in conversation and learning. This itself is a form of attention.</p>
    
    <p>My perspective on this has changed very much so. I do feel like recommendation is something that will be integrated alongside personal assistants; I guess I think my perspective has made poor assumptions based upon market influence.</p>
    
    <h3>From Mitigation to Enhancement</h3>
    
    <p>The ideas began as a thought of personal attention system, introducing mitigation. The thought of technology being used to implement an almost memetic autoimmune system that superimposes your choices and imparts stronger forced means of increasing the likelihood of allocating attention towards aspirations.</p>
    
    <p>A system that begins with an understanding of orientation, that has means within which boundaries can be drawn and epsilons can be defined. Such a system wouldn't be static and set, it would be a daily conversation, an effective informing and learning of oneself. The system would decrease time on device and increase awareness of where one wants to allocate attention. It would effectively identify the ways in which time is being allocated and lead towards conversation about such.</p>
    
    <p>This connects directly to our understanding of autonomy as self-determination<span class="citation" data-citation="Rubel, A., et al. (2020). 'Algorithms and Autonomy: The Ethics of Automated Decision Systems.' Cambridge University Press, p. 550."></span>. Rather than simply removing options (which could be seen as coercive), the system would help users develop their capacity for autonomous decision-making.</p>
    
    <h3>The Social Dimension</h3>
    
    <p>Such a system would best act as a conduit of communication between oneself and their friends. The more one knows about you, the more one can help or hinder your development. This raises important questions about privacy and the role of social context in autonomy development<span class="citation" data-citation="Mackenzie, C., & Stoljar, N. (2000).

    <h3>Key Research Areas</h3>
    
    <p>Going forward, what kind of research, what kind of scoping, what kind of defining and laying out would be helpful?</p>
    
    <p>How can an understanding of autonomy inform development?</p>
    
    <p>Seems like throughout this pondering, several key areas have been particularly interesting:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomy and attention, self-governing and self-determination</strong> - How do we build systems that enhance rather than undermine these capacities?</li>
        <li><strong>External governance of autonomy</strong> - What role should AI systems play in governing human behavior?</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation as a form of exploration</strong> - How can recommendation systems support autonomous exploration rather than addictive consumption?</li>
        <li><strong>Mitigation as a form of attention enhancer</strong> - Can we reframe mitigation as enhancement rather than restriction?</li>
        <li><strong>Importance of decentralized ethical intervention</strong> - How do we ensure AI systems reflect diverse ethical perspectives rather than centralized corporate interests?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Towards Implementation</h3>
    
    <p>The challenge is to build systems that don't just avoid undermining autonomy, but actively enhance it. This requires a fundamental shift from thinking about AI as tools to thinking about them as developmental partners that must be designed with explicit attention to human flourishing.</p>
