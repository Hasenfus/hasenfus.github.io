    <h2>More on Autonomy: Children, AI, and Developmental Concerns</h2>
    
    <p>Building on our understanding of autonomy as self-determination, I want to explore how AI systems interact with human development, particularly in children and adolescents. This raises unique challenges that don't apply to fully autonomous adults.</p>
    
    <h3>The Developmental Framework</h3>
    
    <p>Normal humans are born with the potential capacity for self-determination, which matures through upbringing and exercise into a developed "full" capacity between infancy and adulthood. The "fullness" of this capacity is defined as a "range property"<span class="citation" data-citation="Rawls, J. (1971). A Theory of Justice. Harvard University Press."></span>—sufficient capacity for self-determination. Agents with developed capacities have the full right to self-determination and are fit to be held fully responsible for their deeds.</p>
    
    <p>If one has a lower capacity than that (due to age or disability), one has a right to take part in the autonomous governance of one's life. The capacities for self-determination are interpersonally and contextually malleable<span class="citation" data-citation="Mackenzie, C., & Stoljar, N. (2000). Relational Autonomy: Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy, Agency, and the Social Self. Oxford University Press."></span>. The developmental stage of growing to be autonomous is clearly a special phase in life, where effects of AI or digitalized environments raise special concerns<span class="citation" data-citation="UNICEF (2021). Policy Guidance on AI for Children. UNICEF Office of Global Insight and Policy."></span>.</p>
    
    <h3>The Core Question</h3>
    
    <p>Based upon these ideas, and considering introducing access and communication of children with AI systems, is it paramount that a child should spend a considerable amount of their youth detached from such utilities? The consideration is born out of the idea of developed autonomy. However much, it is clear that the framing of 'good and developed' autonomy has certainly changed over the course of humanity.</p>
    
    <h3>Frameworks and Dimensions</h3>
    
    <p>What different dimensions and frameworks should be taken into account? Is that even a proper question? Considering the model of autonomy presented by AI Systems and Respect for Human Autonomy<span class="citation" data-citation="Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (2021). 'AI Systems and Respect for Human Autonomy.' Special issue on AI ethics and human autonomy."></span>.</p>
    
    <p>There exist 6 dimensions for consideration, thus the relativity of today's present 'optimal' or 'stable' autonomy where in part humanity has converged towards, can be in some part understood within some form of distance metric.</p>
    
    <h3>The Relativity of Development</h3>
    
    <p>This is a very interesting idea. How to frame an essay here? There is a relativity of 'goodness', a relativity of 'shouldness', and a relativity of 'developed capacities'.</p>

    <h3>Tool Use and Cognitive Evolution</h3>
    
    <p>The idea, as Stephen Wolfram noted—'over the course of history, those who used tools tended to do better off than those who didn't'<span class="citation" data-citation="Wolfram, S. (2002). A New Kind of Science. Wolfram Media."></span>. The introduction of tech in children's lives is inevitable, the question is how can we march forward with humans developing even stronger and more advanced cognitive, mental, and imaginative capacities with the offloading of cognitive tasks to an AI system.</p>
    
    <p>You either use it or lose it, and if we are not going to be using it anymore, does it mean that there will exist a sharp decline or just a new normal baseline without such expertise? Almost like the drop in average typing speed because no one needed those anymore.</p>
    
    <h3>Insights Gleaned</h3>
    
    <p>Through this exploration, several insights have emerged: AI systems are no longer just tools—they're becoming developmental agents. They actively participate in shaping human capacities for self-determination, especially in children and adolescents. This realization changes everything about how we should design these systems.</p>
