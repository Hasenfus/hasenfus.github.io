    <h2>Cultivating Virtuous Minds: Essays on Attention, Autonomy, and AI</h2>
    
    <p><em>A series of explorations on building technology that enhances human agency rather than exploiting it</em></p>
    
    <h3>The Personal Journey</h3>
    
    <p>These essays emerged from a personal struggle with technology's grip on my attention and a growing conviction that we can do better. As someone who spent countless hours lost in videogames and social media, I've felt firsthand how current technology can hijack our cognitive steering mechanisms. But I've also experienced the profound potential of tools that genuinely augment human intelligence—from programming languages to mathematical frameworks to thoughtful conversations with AI.</p>
    
    <p>The question that drives this exploration: How do we build technology that cultivates virtue and enhances human autonomy rather than undermining it? This isn't just about creating better apps or interfaces. It's about reimagining the fundamental relationship between human minds and digital systems, especially as AI becomes an increasingly powerful force in human development.</p>
    
    <p>What follows are explorations rather than conclusions—attempts to think through some of the deepest challenges facing us as we navigate an age of artificial intelligence, attention farming, and algorithmic influence.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Intelligence Augmentation and the Attention Trap</h3>

    <p>Growing up, I was a rather competitive child, in pursuit of proving my worth, in pursuit of being the best, in pursuit of fun and attention like most kids are. I grew up with very kind and loving parents, with genuine and generous siblings, and many flaws that have instilled in me scars and strengths. For much of my teen years I was parented and guided by my beloved single mother (who already had much on her plate), and I was enabled free range over my choice over how I spent my time. Thankfully she had us play sports, visit family and friends, and go on adventures, but the bulk of my free time inexorably converged towards videogames and the internet.</p>

    <p>For some time, I had thought the compulsion towards videogames was a weakness and character flaw that was largely spawned out of myself. However, with more nuance and thought, when one considers the situation devoid of freewill they see turtles all the way down. Those turtles are the very many attractors and lack of guard rails in life.</p>
    
    <h3>The Promise and Peril of Augmentation</h3>
    
    <p>Many brilliant thinkers before me have pondered the question of intelligence augmentation—the orientation acquired out of values in humans and aspirations upwards towards bettering the manner within which minds operate. The collective advancements in computer interaction and tools for thought have produced astonishing feats over the years. Ideas such as object-oriented programming, GUIs, and various applications represent notable leaps in abstraction and design that enabled the mind to ride faster bicycles, as Douglas Engelbart envisioned<span class="citation" data-citation="Douglas Engelbart, 'Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework' (1962). Engelbart proposed the idea of using computers to augment human intelligence, coining the term 'intelligence augmentation'."></span>.</p>
    
    <p>I've been reading Michael Nielsen's work on augmenting memory and constructing tools for thought that enable the mediums themselves to facilitate our capacities<span class="citation" data-citation="Michael Nielsen, 'Augmenting Long-term Memory' (2018). Nielsen explores how technology can be used to enhance human memory and learning capabilities."></span>. This vision of technology as cognitive enhancement rather than replacement resonates deeply with my own aspirations.</p>
    
    <p>But here's the paradox: my curiosity and felt responsibility for building virtuous technology has found its space in what can only be described as a sink hole—addiction. The very systems designed to connect and inform us have become masterful at capturing and monetizing our attention.</p>
    
    <h3>Attention as Cognitive Steering</h3>

    <p>To what end can attention be categorically defined? Is it a category of our cognition that can be helped by building tools for thought? Do we want to build technology that interjects in our autonomy? Can we build such a tool alongside other developments to enable meaningful introspection?</p>

    <p>A naive approach would be: "Hey we'll just take all the information in your phone and tell you what's best to do next!" But when the system declares chocolate is bad for you while you crave both chocolate and Instagram scrolling, we've missed something fundamental about human agency.</p>

    <p>Attention operates like the output of a function y = f(x) where f is not just an enormous neural network with billions of neurons—it's a dynamical system riddled with feedback loops, placed as the steering wheel of a bipedal ape. This ape is the product of billions of years of evolution where survival held a pretty high weight in the objective function. But the objective function of evolution, while important and wise, differs from the steering wheel needs of an individual, especially in our current age of abundance and artificial stimuli.</p>

    <p>If the individual doesn't quite know how to orient their ship, why should a machine? This question misses the point entirely.</p>

    <h3>Towards Virtuous Technology</h3>
    
    <p>The objective function is unknown, and attention serves as both the output of an enormously complex system and the north star steering existence toward essence. To build tools for thought focused on cultivating enhanced attention, we must respect and understand the user while providing an adaptive system of principles for enhancement—one that draws upon human history, brilliant minds and mindsets, accumulated knowledge, and philosophical wisdom.</p>

    <p>The end goal of such symbiosis is to better enhance information gathering and knowledge synthesis in the individual. The imperative importance is understanding—seeking understanding.</p>
