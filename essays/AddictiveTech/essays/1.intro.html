            <p>Growing up, I was a rather competitive child, in pursuit of proving my worth, in pursuit of being the best, in pursuit of fun and attention like most kids are. I grew up with very kind and loving parents, with genuine and generous siblings, and many flaws that have instilled in me scars and strengths. For much of my teen years I was parented and guided by my beloved single mother (who already had much on her plate), and I was enabled free range over my choice over how I spent my time. Thankfully she had us play sports, visit family and friends, and go on adventures, but the bulk of my free time inexporably converged towards videogames and the internet. </p>

            <p>For some time, I had thought the compulsion towards videogames was a weakness and character flaw that was largely spawned out of my self, however with more nuance and thought, when one considers the situation devoid of freewill they see turtles all the way down. Those turtles are the very many attractors and lack of guard rails in life.     </p>


            <h3>Intelligence Augmentation? Intelligence Amplification? Hopefully not too much Intellignce Acceleration!</h2>

                Many brilliant thinkers before me have pondered such questions. The orientation aquired out of values in humans and aspirations upwards towards bettering the manner within which minds operate, specifically the ones we humans possess. The collective advancements in computer interaction and tools for thought has produced astonishing feats over the years. Many of which are easy to dismiss; ideas such as object orientated programming, gui's, and all the forms of applications are notable leaps in abstraction and design that enabled the mind to ride faster bicycles

                I have been reading alot of Michael Nielsen's passages about augmenation of memory and constructing tools for thought to enable the mediums themselves in facilitating our capacities

                It now must come as no surprise that my curiosity and felt responsibility in building virtuous technology and tools for thought that enable us better agency and meaning in life has found its space in the form of a sink hole otherwise known as addiction.

                To what end can attention be categorically defined? Is it a category of our cognition that can in some sense be helped by building tools for thought? Do we want to build such technology that interjects in our autonomy. Can we build such a tool alongside other developments to enable meaningful introspection? 
            </p>

            <p>
                A naive approach would be, 
                "Hey we'll just take all the information in your phone and tell you what best to do next!"
                "Well... what does best even mean? I want to eat chocolate and scroll instagram. "
                "The model says chocolate is bad for you. "
            </p>

            <p>
                How to treat attention, a mystery. Almost like the output of function y = f(x) where f is not just an enormous neural network with billions of neurons, its a dynamical system that is riddled with feedback loops thats placed as the steering wheel of a bipedal ape. Perhaps one would suffice to say, said ape is the near-end product of billions of years of evolution where throughout its reign survival has been deemed to have a pretty high weight in the objective function. Safe to say its not sufficient, the objective function of evolution is important and wise, but the objective function and the steering wheel of an individual is especially fraught with darkness and weariness especially these days.

            <p>
                If the individual doesnt quite know what or how to orient their ship, why should a machine? This misses the point. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The idea is that the objective function is unknown, that the behavior of attention is both the output of a enormously complex system and also in many ways the north star steering their existence towards essence. Thus it seems imperative that to build tools for thought focused around cultivating enhanced attention one must respect and understand the user, they also must have an adaptive system of principles underlying how to go about enhancing. Such an adaptive system drawing upon our human history and the brilliant minds and mindsets, the knowledge, and the philosophy.

                The end goal of such a symbiosis is to better enhance the information gathering and knowledge synthesis in the individual. The imperative importance is understanding, its seeking understanding.
