When the word autonomy comes to my mind, I think of agency, a synononym. I think of the Scopenhaur quote, "You can do what you want, but you cannot want what you want."; the idea that our mind is one where we at the present moment are more a function of our condition and environment and less of a force of freewill. It is not a dismissal of freewill, just a healthy admittance that a spectrum of agency is underpinning our existence. 

Upon the thought of a spectrum of agency, upon the idea of condition, I also am reminded of James Allen's quote, "That man is a master of thought, a molder of character, and the maker and shaper of condition, environment, and destiny.". This framing in my eyes and understanding is an expression of Schopenhaers. That however much we are a function of our state and our initial state, we hold will power over our trajectory. The things we must accept are the past and very much most of the present, but one's orientation. The binary distinctions are futile, as the relationship between the things we have the power to change and the things we must accept are in a strange tangled loop. Our character is cultivated through persistent discovery and application, our mind, "may be likened to a garden which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild.". 

A garden, the metaphor Allen used to illustrate our mind, the adaptive system moving through time. A garden, in a beautiful framing by James Carse in Finite and Infinite Games, "“Gardening is not outcome-oriented. A successful harvest is not the end of a gardener's existence, but only a phase of it. As any gardener knows, the vitality of a garden does not end with a harvest. It simply takes another form. Gardens do not "die" in the winter but quietly prepare for another season.”. These three thinkers with these three distinct lines of thought cut so deeply into what autonomy means in its essence. 

The notion of not wanting what we want stems from our need for cultivation and our primordial sensitivity to impulse. Being a master, a molder, a maker, and a shaper of ones mind is a means of framing and orienting the notion of mind and how a mind is to view its life is through responsible agency. The mind is ultimately a garden, playing finite games is a means of momentary bliss and vitality, an infinite framing on autonomy, on agency, and on human life doesnt incinuate an indefinite life with no end, it means a life of playing and creating in infinite positive sum games that focus ones lens on orientation, discovery, and cultivation.
